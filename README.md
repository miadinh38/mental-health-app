# Setup

## Backend

### Quick Run

Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies with:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Create database

Use the `psql -U root -h localhost -p 5432 -d Mindora` command to login to the PostgreSQL server with the username `root` and the password `secret`. This command **MUST** be run in a vagrant terminal, we are using the PostgreSQL installation provided in the vagrant environment. M1/M2 and WSL2 users can execute this command in their terminal.

Create a database with the command `CREATE DATABASE Mindora;`.

Create a new `.env` file and copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the necessary PostgreSQL configuration. The `node-postgres` library uses these environment variables by default.

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=secret
DB_NAME=Mindora
DB_PORT=5432
```

### Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Reset database

To reset the database and seed it with initial data, run the following command:

```bash
npm run db:reset
```

Use the browser to navigate to http://localhost:8080.

## Frontend - Next JS

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Use the browser to navigate to http://localhost:3000.
